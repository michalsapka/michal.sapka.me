# Hello

I’m Michał. I am a husband, software engineer, sci-fi geek, anime fanboy, 
and a [jazz fan](https://itunes.apple.com/profile/msapka) from Poland living in
Cracow. That, more or less, summarizes me after 30 something years.

[How should you contact me?]({% link other/contact.md %})

## Software engineering

Outside of creating software, from time to time I have some strong 
opinions about it.

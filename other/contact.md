title: How to contact me
---

Ok, communication is hard. I get it. Let’s get ground rules out of the way.

If you need me as soon as possible, **iMessage**/SMS me. That’s the fastest 
and most reliable way. I am most likely very closely to my phone. And, since you know 
my number, we are close friends.

If you need to do something in the coming hours, email me. I can process the message 
and respond when I have some time, most likely a few hours. I will like you for it!

If you need to me to do something in the coming days, Facebook me. I don’t use 
Facebook much and hate Messenger, so I may not read what you sent me for a long
time.

If you want to upset me, call me. But don’t. We are not savages any more!

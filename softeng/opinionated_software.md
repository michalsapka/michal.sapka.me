title: Your software should be opinionated
---
Recently, I’ve been thinking about software I use and why I hate Atlassian software so 
much. It all came down to my take on the ontology of software.

Dear Software industry: You are not selling me chair. You are selling a result of 
thousands of hours of extremely inteligent people’s work. I’m sure you’ve though 
long and hard about what works best. You know (or, at least, you think you know) what 
process work best. This is what you are selling. The tool (aka „software”) is just a 
by-product.

Jira tries to fit into every possible process. It gives every possible option, you can 
integrate it with everything and spend hours trying to get anything done. Confluence is 
a collaborative hole where information is created and lost forever. Hipchat is just 
bunch of virtual rooms full of people screaming.

I use that software everyday and yet it doesn’t give me anything. The fact that it is 
software, and not a bunch of cards on the wall is, all in all, meaningless. And outside 
of being a software, what does it actually do? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. It does not 
solve any real problems my company encounters. It’s only a tool. Ultimately, what is 
the difference between Confluence and Dropbox Paper? Slack and Hipchat? Jira and any of 
the minion existing scrum software? Purely technical.

What I expect software to do is to challenge me and try to enforce what I should and 
shouldn’t be doing in order to be productive. When it comes to features, for every „yes” 
give a thousand times a „no”. Give me the minimal scope that works, and let me work 
around any potential gaps. Is there a chance that I want to do something that is not 
productive? Help me not do it. Force me to adjust my process.  Make me rethink it. After 
all, you are the expert. I am just a user.

There is another problem. You, most likely, are not able to make a completely elastic 
software that still works. It’s very hard to make a great and simple software. Making 
big soft is extremely hard. Windows and Android suffered terribly from trying to run on 
everything. Jira has such a terrible user experience as a result of trying to do 
everything, that it needs internal language just to be able cope with it.

Also, I can’t do anything without the dot menu. Seriously. The single best feature of 
Jira is a hack to mitigate it’s terrible user experience. 

I can use a chair as a chair, as a table, as a wall for blanket fortress, as a weapon 
against zombies, bookshelf. A can buy a million varieties of the same chair to feed my 
liking. After all, it’s just chair. I may be a very great, comfortable, well build chair, 
but in the end it is still a chair. But I’m not trying to get stuff done using a chair. I 
do that with software, so why are you selling me a chair?

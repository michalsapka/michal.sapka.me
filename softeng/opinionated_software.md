title: I want your software to be opinionated
excerpt: My take on software's ontology
---

Recently, I’ve been thinking about software I use and why I hate Atlassian software so 
much. It all came down to my take on the ontology of software.

Dear Software industry: You are not selling me a chair. You are selling a result of 
thousands of hours of extremely intelligent people’s work. I’m sure you’ve thought 
long and hard about what works best. You know (or, at least, you think you know) what 
processes work best. This is what you are selling. The tool (aka „software”) is just a 
by-product.

Jira tries to fit into every possible process. It gives you every possible option, you can 
integrate it with everything and waste hours trying to get anything done. Confluence is 
a collaborative hole where information is created and lost forever. Hipchat is just 
bunch of virtual rooms full of people screaming.

I use that software everyday and yet it doesn’t give me anything. The fact that it is 
software, and not a bunch of cards on the wall, is all in all, meaningless. And outside 
of being a software, what does it actually do? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. It does not 
solve any real problems my company encounters. It’s only a tool. Ultimately, what is 
the difference between Confluence and Dropbox Paper? Slack and Hipchat? Jira and any of 
the million existing scrum based software? Purely technical.

What I expect software to do is to challenge me and try to enforce what I should and 
shouldn’t be doing in order to be productive. When it comes to features, for every „yes” 
give a thousand times „no”. Give me the minimal scope that works, and let me work 
around any potential gaps. Is there any chance that I want to do something that is not 
productive? Help me not do it. Force me to adjust my process.  Make me rethink it. After 
all, you are the expert. I am only a user. Use your software as a medium to say something. 
Don't try to fit everyone, don't attempt to do everything. You will fail at it. 

Eliminate everything but the necessary and be ruthless while doing it. Those features are 
just distractions. Like  Antoine de Saint-Exupery once wrote, "perfection is achieved, not 
when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away"
